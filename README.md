A Python wrapper for the [GridCut C++ library](http://www.gridcut.com/index.php) for solving graph cuts in regular grids.

**Implemented functions:**
 * gridcut.maxflow_2D_4C(...)
 * gridcut.maxflow_2D_4C_potts(...)
 * gridcut.maxflow_2D_8C_potts(...)


## Installation

Actually the latest version is **1.3** as it is set up in the _setup.py_
